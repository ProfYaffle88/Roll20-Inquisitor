The majority of this sheet was adapted from the Dark-Heresy sheet by [NeirinD](https://github.com/NeirinD). Thank you for lovingly crafting an elegant sheet that provided the bones and sinew of this personal project.
The original Dark Heresy Sheet can be found [here](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Dark_Heresy)

I hope to produce something worthy of being added to the Roll2-character-sheets repositiory.
